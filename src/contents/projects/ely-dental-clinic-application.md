## Overview

Ely Dental Clinic Application is a web-based application that organizes dental clinic operations. By being web-based, it can be easily opened on any device without extensive configuration.

## Problem Statement

Previously, Ely Dental Clinic relied on a basic spreadsheet program to store patient information and used regular paper to store medical records. Therefore, this application was built to help dental clinic owner simplify patient management, optimize medical records control, and make administration easier.

## Key Features

- Patients' data and medical records management.
- User authentication with roles implementation such as clinic owner, dentists, admins, and assistants.
- Provision of disease data for medical records based on [ICD-10 Version:2019](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/K00-K14).
- Treatment types and medicines management.
- Financial management, such as income from patient payments and expenses for purchasing medical equipment.
- A daily practice report for the health centre as a generated PDF file.
- Recapitulation of dentists' income calculated based on the percentage of the doctor's share.

## Responsibility

As a single software developer, I am responsible for all application development processes from start to finish, from collecting clinic requirements, programming, and deployment. I also created a database schema based on business needs which can be seen below:

## Results

This application made dental clinic management more manageable and centralized. It significantly reduced the time needed to search for patient data, which allowed staffs to focus more on patient care. It also minimized errors that may arise from manual recording and calculations.
