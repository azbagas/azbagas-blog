This is my website to showcase my posts and portfolio. It was built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the framework and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the components.


## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
